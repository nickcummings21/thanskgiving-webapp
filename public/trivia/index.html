            <h3>A History of Giving Thanks</h3>
            <p>Setting aside time to give thanks for one's blessings, along with holding feasts to celebrate a harvest,
                are both practices that long predate the European settlement of North America. The first documented
                thanksgiving services in territory currently belonging to the United States were conducted by Spaniards
                and the French in the 16th century. Wisdom practices such as expressing gratitude, sharing, and giving
                away, are integral to many indigenous cultures and communities.</p>

            <h3>The "First" Thanksgiving</h3>
            <p>Americans trace the Thanksgiving holiday to a 1621 celebration at the Plymoth Plantation, where the
                settlers held a harvest feast after a successful growing season. The Pilgrims celebrated at Plymouth for
                three days after their first harvest in 1621. It included 50 persons who were on the Mayflower (all who
                remained of the 100 who had landed) and 90 Native Americans. The feast was cooked by the four adult
                Pilgrim women who survived their first winter in the New World (Eleanor Billington, Elizabeth Hopkins,
                Mary Brewster, and Susanna White), along with their young daughters.</p>

            <h3>Thanksgiving around the World</h3>
            <p>Thanksgiving Day is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in Canada, the United States, some of
                the Caribbean islands, and Liberia. It began as a day of giving thanks for the blessing of the harvest
                and of the preceding year. Similarly named festival holidays occur in Germany and Japan. Thanksgiving
                is celebrated on the second Monday of October in Canada and on the fourth Thursday of November in the
                United States, and around the same part of the year in other places. Although Thanksgiving has historical
                roots in religious and cultural traditions, it has long been celebrated as a secular holiday as well.</p>
